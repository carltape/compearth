matlab scripts for manipulating seismic moment tensors

Instructions:
- some of these scripts require rotation-related scripts;
  the path to these scripts can be added by running load_mt.m,
  which can be called from a startup file such as ~/.matlab/startup.m
- you can check if the paths have been set by typing 'path'
  in the matlab command window

Background:
