To check out this directory from the google project compearth, try this from a command line:

svn checkout https://compearth.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tutorials/optimization

(This assumes you have svn, which is a pretty standard program for linux machines.)
If this does not work for you, please email me.

---------------------------

This directory is aimed at illustrating various gradient-based optimization techniques,
which are outlined in Section 6.22 of Albert Tarantola's 2005 SIAM book, Inverse Problem Theory.

Tarantola's book can be purchased from SIAM but is also provided on his website:
http://www.ipgp.jussieu.fr/~tarantola

The main Matlab code is optimization.m

The corresponding details, including figures, can be found in
./INFO/optimization_guide.pdf
