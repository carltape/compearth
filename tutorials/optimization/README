This directory is aimed at illustrating various gradient-based optimization techniques,
which are outlined in Section 6.22 of Albert Tarantola's 2005 SIAM book, Inverse Problem Theory.

Tarantola's book can be purchased from SIAM but is also provided on his website:
http://www.ipgp.jussieu.fr/~tarantola

The main Matlab code is optimization.m

The corresponding details, including figures, can be found in
