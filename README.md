[1] momenttensor  
contains scripts (Matlab, Mathematica, GMT) for plotting and interpreting full moment tensors. These scripts supplement the following publications:  
  W. Tape and C. Tape  
    A geometric setting for moment tensors, GJI 2012  
    A geometric comparison of source-type plots for moment tensors, GJI 2012  
    Angle between principal axis triples, GJI 2012  
    The classical model for moment tensors, GJI 2013  
    A uniform parameterization of moment tensors, GJI 2015

[2] surfacevel2strain  
uses spherical wavelets to estimate scalar and vector fields on the surface of a sphere. The practical applications include (1) constructing a smooth topographic surface from discrete scalar observations (for example, a Moho map from a set of receiver functions); (2) constructing a smooth strain-rate map from a set of discrete GPS vector observations on the Earth's surface.
