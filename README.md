[1] surfacevel2strain
uses spherical wavelets to estimate scalar and vector fields on the surface of a sphere. The practical applications include (1) constructing a smooth topographic surface from discrete scalar observations (for example, a Moho map from a set of receiver functions); (2) constructing a smooth strain-rate map from a set of discrete GPS vector observations on the Earth's surface. Reference: Tape, Muse, Simons, Dong, Webb, "Multiscale estimation of GPS velocity fields," Geophysical Journal International, 2009.

[2] momenttensor
contains some scripts (Matlab, Mathematica, GMT) for plotting and interpreting full moment tensors on the fundamental lune. Reference: W. Tape and C. Tape, "A geometric setting for moment tensors," Geophysical Journal International, 2012. See also W. Tape and C. Tape, "The classical model for moment tensors," Geophysical Journal International, 2013.
