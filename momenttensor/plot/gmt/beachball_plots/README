These input files and scripts are designed for testing plotting routines for full moment tensors. 
Unless noted, the default codes were tested with GMT 4.5.3 using a modified utilmeca.h

---

EXAMPLE 1:
csh -f lune_gmtXXX.csh
produces the ps file lune_XXX.ps

lune_gmt453dreger.csh --> lune_gmt453dreger.pdf (good)
lune_gmt544.csh       --> lune_gmt544.pdf (problems)
lune_gmt600.csh       --> lune_gmt600.pdf (good)
lune_gmt600pr2018.csh --> (same as lune_gmt600.pdf) (good)

---

For examples 2 and 3, you will need to have the full compearth repository available; or at least have the datafiles present in the directory at ../dfiles/

EXAMPLE 2:
lune_beachballs.pl
   --> lune_hammer_iplot2_lplot1_kplot1.pdf
       (good)
lune_beachballs_gmt6.pl gmt600pr2018
   --> lune_hammer_iplot2_lplot1_kplot1_gmt600pr2018.pdf
       (problems with lambda2=0 sixth set)
lune_beachballs_gmt6.pl gmt600pr2067
   --> lune_hammer_iplot2_lplot1_kplot1_gmt600pr2067.pdf
       (good)

In these figures, there are arcs plotted for directions of eigenvalue space where one of the eiganvalues of the moment tensor is zero: lambda3 = 0 (top), lambda2 = 0 (upper left to lower right), and lambda1 = 0 (bottom).

EXAMPLE 3:
uncomment lines 30 and 31 in lune_beachballs.pl, then run
produces the ps file lune_ngeo_iplot2_lplot1_kplot1.ps
